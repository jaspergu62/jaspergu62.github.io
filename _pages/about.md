Jiazhen Gu is currently a principal engineer at Huawei Hong Kong Research Center. He was a postdoctoral researcher in the [Automated Reliable Intelligent Software Engineering (ARISE) Lab](http://ariselab.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/) at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/), mentored by Prof. [Michael R. Lyu](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/lyu/). Jiazhen Gu received both Ph.D. and B.S. degrees from [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/), supervised by Prof. [Xin Wang](https://faculty.fudan.edu.cn/wangxin/zh_CN/) and Prof. [Yangfan Zhou](https://appsrv.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~yfzhou/).

His research focuses on software reliability engineering for cloud & AI systems, including:

- AIOps for cloud systems
  - Adopts data-driven methods to automate operations tasks (*e.g.,* anomaly detection, root cause analysis) based on heterogeneous data (*e.g.,* metrics, logs, alerts, and traces)
- Reliability of AI systems
  - Robustness/Fairness of AI models
  - Reliability of AI infrastructure (*e.g.,* TensorFlow and TVM)
